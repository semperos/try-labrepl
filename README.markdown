# What is it?

Labrepl is an environment for exploring the Clojure language. It
includes:

* a web application that presents a set of lab exercises with
  step-by-step instructions
* an interactive repl for working with the lab exercises, both on the command line and in the browser
* solutions with passing tests 
* up-to-date versions of Clojure and a bunch of other libraries to explore

See the Wiki for getting started with NetBeans/Enclojure, Eclipse/Counterclockwise, Maven, Mac/Linux command line, Windows command line, IDEA/La Clojure, and Emacs.

```
